# Solar-System
A web page created for my high school Digital Competence Certificate using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Embark on a journey through our beloved Solar System and rediscover the beauty of its eight planets along with the other celestial bodies that inhabit it.
At the end of your trip, test your knowledge with a fun little quiz!
